# Tutorial

## Getting started

- Clone the [workshop repository](https://github.com/bruno-f-cruz/inc-2025-harp-workshop).
- Run `setup.cmd` from the `./bonsai` directory to install Bonsai and its dependencies.

## Following the examples

Each example builds on the previous one, so it is recommended to follow them in the order presented in the table of contents.

If you run into problems assembling the examples, you can copy-and-paste each snippet by clicking the clipboard icon (top-right corner) of each code block, and pasting it into the Bonsai workflow editor.

If you have any questions or find any issues, please open an Issue on the [workshop repository](https://github.com/bruno-f-cruz/inc-2025-harp-workshop/issues)
